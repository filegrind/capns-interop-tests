"""Router process helper for 3-tier interoperability tests.

Router = RelaySwitch + RelayMaster in a subprocess.
Communicates with test orchestration via stdin/stdout.
Connects to independent relay host processes via Unix sockets.

Architecture:
  Test (Engine) → Router (subprocess) ←socket→ Host1 (subprocess) → Plugin(s)
                                       ←socket→ Host2 (subprocess) → Plugin(s)
                                       ←socket→ Host3 (subprocess) → Plugin(s)

Router and Hosts are independent siblings (not parent-child).
Relay connections are non-fatal - if broken, router continues running.
Router aggregates capabilities from all connected hosts.
