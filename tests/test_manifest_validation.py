"""Manifest validation interoperability tests.

Tests that all plugins properly declare CAP_IDENTITY in their manifests.
Per the capns protocol specification, ALL plugins MUST explicitly declare
CAP_IDENTITY (cap:) - no implicit fallbacks allowed.

This is enforced by PluginRuntime.with_manifest() which fails hard if
CAP_IDENTITY is missing from the manifest.

Architecture:
    Test (Engine) → Router (RelaySwitch) → Host (PluginHost) → Plugin
